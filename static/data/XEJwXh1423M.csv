62,"1:02 Jimin serving SHINEE Taemin moves.  I wonder if they dance together when they hang out?  It would be awesome if Jimin has a Jimin-in-the-Studio podcast just like our Hobi has Hope-on-the-Street.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to see him dance in front of a mirror.  While giving pointers --- it's an educational podcast after all.  Speaking of educational, it is equally educational if we see Jimin exchanging dance pointers with his SM friends or the BTS Dance Line.  Thank you for coming to my TED braindump.",3
