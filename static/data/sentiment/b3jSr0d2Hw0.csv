Percebem o Jungkook depois cantando a música do Jimin e o mesmo fica na porta quando ouve e começa a cantar também, fofos. JK não queria que JM ficasse sozinho, onwt. Reparem que JK falou: “Desculpe...” e para ser desculpado cantou a música de Jimin e o mesmo ouviu 

Um pequeno análise aqui dhxhdhdu

4:23 JK falando: “Desculpe...” enquanto JM o olhava / 4:50 JK cantando, 4:53 Jimin ouve e começa a cantar também


*Inglês*
4:20 JIKOOK, CUTE TIME
They perceive Jungkook after singing Jimin's music and he stays at the door when he hears and starts singing, too, cute. JK did not want JM to be alone, onwt. Notice that JK said: ""Sorry ..."" and to be excused sang the music of Jimin and the same heard
