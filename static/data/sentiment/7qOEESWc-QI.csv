1566,"26:06 why does this sound like a Fanfiction...?

They strolled within the lines of the metallic artwork and Taehyung suggesting it's purpose.

""Does this mean connection?"" he asked, hands buried in the pockets of his coat.

""That's right,"" Jimin replied, stepping toward him, ""We meet again, here today.""

Taehyung laughed and agreed, ""Yes.""

A moment of silence before Jimin spoke again: ""Perhaps you and I are connected.""

He glanced at the silver wires as if it reminded him of a tale of strings that attach people to one another no matter where they are in the universe. Taehyung stepped back as Jimin approached, almost shyly, and turned his attention back to the masterpiece before asking, ""Where does it begin and end?""

""You can't see,"" Jimin said, looking into his eyes, ""That's what I was going to say.""

Taehyung knew that Jimin was not talking about the art and his heart beat a bit faster at that realization.

""I..."" He held his breath as Jimin stepped past him, not sure what to respond.

""I will always be here,"" he said eventually.

Jimin smiled and held his hand out for Taehyung to shake, which he obliged.

""I'll always be here too,"" Jimin assured, ""by your side.""

They held hands longer than necessary as Taehyung thought, ""Because you are my Soulmate.""
