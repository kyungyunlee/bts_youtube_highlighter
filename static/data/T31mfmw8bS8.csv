Even JK, being a composer, director, having his name included in the direction of the album, manages to be as arrogant as he is! It's in Jimin, the ""secret"" that they can't comment on! Just pay attention to the interviews and episodes, which you will realize, how much they have to disguise, that they can't take him anymore! In this interview in this video, notice some times RM or JHope saying something to him! Jimin is sarcastic! ""Run ep 117"", it's there for anyone to understand what I'm talking about! In all the videos they are releasing too! Just notice if his reaction has to do with what he says!! Can you notice sarcasm? So pay attention to them!  Do not agree with me? OK! I am not to blame if it is not everyone who has the ability to perceive attitudes, even if this are being desguising! They are even inconsistent with the episode!",0
