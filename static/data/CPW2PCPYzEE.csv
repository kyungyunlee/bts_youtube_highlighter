1350,"22:30 방탄은 이런 팀웍이 존재함. 공식적인 자리에서 텐션을 유지하며 분위기를 만들기 위해 노력하는게 사실 부담스럽다는 걸 미안해하며조심스럽게 말하는 맴버(반복되는 순간이 있었을텐데 불만 갖지 않는 제이홉), 바로 이어서 책임감을 느끼는 리더가 내가 아니고 우리가 커버 칠게여. 진도 열심히 하겠다고 바로 이해하고 소통하는 모습. 모두가 노력해야 한다고 화제를 꺼내주는 리더의 통찰력도 대단함. 기획한것도 아닌데 자연스럽게 우러나오는 걸 보니 BTS의 가치는 이런것이다 싶어서 공유합니다.",2

1783,29:43 When JK explained how RM has changed over the years like how he used to be relatively kinda relaxed before debut but then he started becoming more sirius and started to think more about a lot of stuff worry much more...and RM said that's exactly how it was like a proud parent...I dunno like a parent who was touched that his child had paid attention to deatils about him and made an effort to understand what he went through...it just melted my heart I can't really explain it,0

Such a humble response was that. 
If I were that girl. I must have acted differently.

I remember, 
Once I wrote a whole essay and  send long voice clip to one  who told me that he hates  my precious V  
I blocked him and deleted his contact from my phone. But I was so pissed for 2-3 days.. It offended me very badly. 
Even  now I am writing too much..😔

I guess we don't have to do something to shut their mouth. Just let them see our boys achieving great success and prove them all wrong.",26
