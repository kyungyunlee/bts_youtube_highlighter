He can appreciate people who need to be appreciated. Namjoon does so much like produce, make lyrics, translate, etc. Not only does he do those things, he also an amazing leader and probably the best leader I’ve ever seen. I take a leadership class and everything I learned to be a leader and all the qualities you need to have to be one, is what Namjoon has. He has all the qualities to be a leader and not everyone has those qualities, not even my teacher who teaches the class. Namjoon deserves more love and attention than he gets because he such an amazing leader, member, son, and person in general. Love you Namjoon and Suga 💜💜💜",65
