Jimin appears, 3:16 - 4:07 was Jimin dancing. Jimin's dancing was so graceful, fluid, beautiful, breathtaking, amazing, wonderful, great, it was art. 4:08 the music for Suga's solo starts playing, 4:19 Suga appears on the screen, 5:21 he is done. 5:22 the music for Jungkook's solo (the music is a different version of their song Save Me) starts playing, 5:40 he appears (in the pre recorded version of the intro is the video he is in, not in live b/c his solo involved water, & he needed to be dry for next song). 5:45 - 6:38 was Jungkook's dancing. 6:46 J Hope appears, 6:48 music starts playing (it has a couple lines from their song Fake Love), 6:55 - 7:49 was the dancing, 6:48 - 7:49 the music played. In this practice video I can better see his moves, at the awards show it was so dark which meant I couldn't see his moves as well as if there was more light. 7:52 the music (there is a line from their song Dionysus) starts playing for RM's part. 8:20 RM appears, 8:32 he grabs the staff, 8:46 he lifts the staff a little bit & thumps it on the floor.",0
