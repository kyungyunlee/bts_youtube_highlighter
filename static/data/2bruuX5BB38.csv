213,"3:33 seriously I hate it when Taehyung can't do this motion properly like Jimin and Jin do in every comeback show, even can't do this as himself in MV !
ah yeah I luv his undeniable aura/ attractives and handsomeness; and  of course can't help to addicting to his own creative and unique motions.
But this time, maybe I like ""wipping mirror"" choreography so much, maybe I know it quite exhausting to it..., I think V's a little bit lazy?!
....just really want V to dance it in the right way next time",0
