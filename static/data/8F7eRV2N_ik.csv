246,"4:06 I absolutely love this part of Taehyung! (on a loop forever plz) He puts his whole self into his moves and I’m so proud to see him recognized as a lead dancer. 

JIMIN is breathtaking as always. His moves are sharp, precise, explosive and graceful at the same time. It always a pleasure to watch him! 

JungKook goes HARD, like HARD HARD. He’s always giving his 1000%. I can feel his energy through the screen. His moves are spot on every time.

J-Hope dances so effortlessly. I look at him and he’s so fluid. He really owns every move.  

SUGA, JIN and RM are not falling behind at all specially RM! They are only getting better~ I’m always cheering for them becuz they’re giving it their everything with confidence!",48
