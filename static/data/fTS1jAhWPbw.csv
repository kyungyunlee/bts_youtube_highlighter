65,"1:05 there's a reason why Kook is in the centre for that move. Just look at the way he moves. Eventhough Hope is the main dancer and Jimin the lead, Kooks move are more wholesome to look at as he incorporates both styles in him when he dances. He can't dance like Hope's style alone and nor like Jimin's style alone. But he uses a little of both in his moves which makes his dance look wholesome during group choreos",0

110,"1:50 it's interesting how in this part of the choreography the members leave the ""stage"" in twos and yoongi is about to leave with tae but hoseok grabs him and turns him around. maybe it might not mean much besides the fact that yoongi has a part of the verse with hoseok but after watching the live stage, they make it look like they're having a conversation and i can't help but think it relates to the ego and shadow since hoseok sang ego and yoongi sang shadow. it could represent the ego acknowledging the shadow, or bring it into consciousness, according to the map of the soul book ideas they're basing this on.
just an observation i thought was interesting",59
