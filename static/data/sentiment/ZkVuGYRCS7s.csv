3:01 La reacción de Suga es la misma que tengo yo cuando veo fotos de él (Suga) 💜✨😝😅

*_Les digo que cuando comenzaron a reaccionar sonreí como nunca, fue demasiado, y luego al terminar, lloré muchísimo, fue impactante el cambio de emoción, fue automático... Han crecido mucho, y cambiado para bien, comenzaron con muy poca experiencia siendo unos completos bebés, y ahora están aquí, el grupo K-pop más grande, el fandom más grande de todos los fandoms actuales, ARMY está muy orgullosa de todo lo que han logrado, los amamos muchísimo, pero en serio, MUCHO, al menos yo, los amo más que nada, prometo que me quedaré aquí por siempre, pertenezco al fandom correcto y lo sé._*


*_Estaba viendo tranquila éste video, y mi gato estaba en la cocina, luego se escuchó un ruido de agua derramándose, mi gatito salió corriendo, fui a ver, había derramado la comida del almuerzo de ayer 🙈 se la íbamos a dar a mi perro, quedó todo mojado con el jugo de la carne, y estuve como 30 minutos en limpiar y secar todo, lo peor es porque estoy sola en mi casa, y bueno, ahora a seguir viendo el vídeo_*

*5:43** NO ME HABÍA DADO CUENTA DEL CARTEL DE LOS HERMANITOS MENORES!*
