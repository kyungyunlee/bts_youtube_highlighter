150,"2:30 That part when jin asked we dont have cooking wine ""sul"", jungkook actually said ""hyung, you have your ibsul"". Ibsul means lips. ""Sul"" (wine) to ""ib-sul"" (lips). This is a korean wordplay. Thats why the members were shouting on him and kookie gave snoring sound bcs he was being cringy. Lol! So the subtitles that bighit put (the ""dont whine it though"") wasnt the actual meaning, maybe bcs they didnt want to explain the long wordplay kookie made that time 😂",0
