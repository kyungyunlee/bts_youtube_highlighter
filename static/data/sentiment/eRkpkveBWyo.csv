But seriously, this video makes me cry. All of the members have come so far.. if you showed this dance to their past selves, they wouldn't be able to believe that they'd dance this in the future probably.
 Everyone's talking about Taehyung, and they're right. Taehyung is now officially part of the dance line, and his dancing has improved so much, I'm so proud of him and so are you guys probably :') Jungkook, Jimin and Hobi's dancing are so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off, especially Jungkook's body rolls, Jimin's flawless leaps and Hobi's amazing popping like he doesn't have any bones. Yoongi, Namjoon and Seokjin have come so far as well.. Yoongi's rap part was just stunning, and Jin's face makes the dance other-worldly, and Namjoon's moves are so smooth and coordinated now. They're also in perfect sync.

 They've all come so far.. We can take them further. We'll make them the spotlight in every award show! We'll make them forget the hard days when they used to choose between a bus ride home or a cup of warm ramen. Won't we?
