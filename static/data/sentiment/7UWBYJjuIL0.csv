My story is I'm a Christian and I can't stan you easily because no one's supports me. In short, I have the most least opportunity to buy some merchandise, go to the concert, buy some album. They always discouraged me to love you guys. But it's too hard for me because.  I already loved you not as idols but as who you are. Sometimes I want to stop this but I said to myself that I won't give up until I fulfill my dreams. And that is to become a doctor and to meet you. And that is the reason why I am still walkin' with you guys. You all thought me how to love myself, speak myself. You guys became my inspiration. 🙃😊 사랑해 BTS💜💜💜",4,0.9939

Here are the lyrics from answer: ly ""Even all the scars from your mistakes make up your constellation""

P.S.
1:16 Jin ( I think so because in fake love, a similar situation happens where the room is in chaos)

1:24. Namjoon's solo Reflection

1:27 this scene is similar to a scene of fake love, where the floor beneath jungkook starts falling

1:30 here a huge wave is after jungkook on the road. Maybe it's a reference to how he dies in a car accident in the storyline

1:44 this scene is very similar to a scene in Run. Where Tae falls in the water.

I think all of the BTS albums and albums have strings attached to them. There is a certain trilogy. Their music is wonderful, it brings people together, eliminates social prejudices, regardless of the aristocracy or upper class. They bring joy. loving them makes teenage kids more mature. BTS is a wonderful miracle
