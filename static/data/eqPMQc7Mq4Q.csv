168,2:48JIMIN💓,46
180,"3:00 I can't help replaying that part over and over again (like with the entire song on every electronic divise I have hehe), #JIMIN's both singing and dancing skills always blow my mind and gives me goossebumps along with a shot of adrenaline at the same time!

3:00 no puedo evitar reproducir esa parte una y otra vez (así como todo el video en cada aparato electrónico que tengo), tanto las habilidades musicales de #JIMIN como su habilidad para bailar siempre vuelan mi mente, mi piel se pone de gallina y mi adrenalina aumenta al mismo tiempo!

Also #HAPPYJKDAY",31

219,"03:39 is it just me, or Jimin does look tired? 
(I mean duh, he owned that stage, he killed that hard choreo, it must have taken a lot of energy, but he seems especially tired, and I'm kinda worried...)",0
137,2:17 holy shit that's so sexy-,0
18,0:18 get it namjoon!,0
52,"0:52 you can see yoongi turned too big and was covering jimin but moved as he danced to get himself to his right position. when you think about it, alot of details go into performing. not just memorizing the choreo and feeling the song, but being aware of your space while sharing the stage with other people. and being able to adapt when little mistakes like that happen, and looking calm and collected while doing so. yoongi demonstrated that perfectly! overall i hope bts don't overwork themselves and hope they are healthy and happy!",0
