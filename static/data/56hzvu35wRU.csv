65,"1:05. '아미' is 'Army' in Korean. Jungkook is making '아미' with bottles. Definitely He misses Army so much. and at 1:06 Jimin interrupted while taking out one bottle from the spelling (due to Jimin, last vowel became too short) and said ""do you know what's the last thing you do to complete this spelling?"" and He drinks the water bottle and puts the bottle again back to the previous place. Now it is a perfect Korean spelling '아미'.( I am a native Korean. so please forgive my imperfect english)",95
