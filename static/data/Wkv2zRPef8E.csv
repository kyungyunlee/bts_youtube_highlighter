They said they almost disbanded that time so i'm like, i'm crying and dying 😪😪😪😪😪. I almost fainted that time cauz of that,cause of they almost disbanded,because my life is BTS my world is BTS. BTS is my Everything. So I can't live without seeing them performing, whithout seing them Happy and with beautiful smiles on their faces. I can't live without them. And seeing them crying sadly makes me cry too cauz i can feel their soft heart,so seeing them crying makes  me sad,cry. Bts makes me confident even more, bts teach me how to love myself. And i will never ever forget them and their cuteness,smiles. So BTS Thank you for everything. We will always support you 7 Angels. Saranghae~~~💙💖🖤❤💛💚💜 
Borahe~~~💙💖🖤❤💛💚💜

And Kookie too, the thing he does at 16:58 before the camera zooms on him! He's so weird but I absolutely love it!!
And I love how even Jin is crying and Joonie has teary eyes, but then there's Yoongi with his adorable Gummybear-Smile! And did anyone besides me notice, that he patted Hobi's butt at 16:51?😂💜
Then at 19:22 Taetae breaks down too and it just breaks my hearteu, eventhough they're all crying of happiness. 😩💔 

20:14 Yoongi and the member's butts. A love story😂
