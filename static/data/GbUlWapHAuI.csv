 tho Suga is definitely the deserving centre, sucking in and.... centering your attention,
my favorites in this part are jungkook who shares so much energy, makes you wanna join, taehyung who makes you feel invited personally, not to join, but watch, and RM who _is_ the energy himself. Special mentions Jin for making it look effortless, careless and Jimin for being an absolute viper with it. Hobi is the light in a long day, but in this take of the rehearsal, he makes it look automatic, but not necessarily with any emotion, I guess",9
