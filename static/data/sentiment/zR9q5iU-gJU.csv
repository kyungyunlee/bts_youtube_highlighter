😭Nooooo, Namjoon. I know you were laughing and joking around, but I hope it doesn’t feel too bad or controlled. As always, thank you BTS for working hard to be here. I hope that you and other idols have good working conditions and schedules, and that BigHit is the more lenient, safer company we love to think it is. Taking many hours out of your day to choreograph (which is mentally and physically challenging) is part of why we love you. I’m sorry you have felt trapped there, please stay as healthy as possible. 💜💜💜",0,0.9949
