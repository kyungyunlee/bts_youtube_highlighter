I'm wheezing",1
120,2:00 umm I know I'm wrong I just seem to need confirmation but doesn't it seem like Suga lip synced half of the rap?.. I dunno maybe it's just that I couldn't really hear his voice cuz the Mic was soft or something but I can't hear their voices in a sense..,0
222,3:42 my favorite part.,1
123,2:03 Jimin gives me No more dream vibes very much,19

130,2:10 the move Tae did was literally insane... I've been watching it since its release and Mr. Kim that's total illegal specifically to do it with tattoos on your body,32
37,0:37 love that part with he dance and everything RM!,0
149,2:29 awww our baby mochi was really enjoying his dance until he realised something 😳😂,31
126,"2:06 There's  everyone hurrying to give their drumsticks to the backup dancer... and then there's PARK JIMIN just taking his time to add in one last ""ugh"" to the beat. He didn't even bother to look away from the camera--the confidence is so SWAG. Jimin knows how to take the move and make it HIS style. That was hot.",1
127,2:07 I like to see how their pass the stick drum to the dancer. So smooth ❤️.Fighting BTS!! ARMY Fighting!!! We always stand beside you BTS!.,1
