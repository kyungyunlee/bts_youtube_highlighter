289,4:49 Jimin’s voice cracked. I bet other groups heard and laughed😤😤,0
10,"0:10 Epic. Jimin's nails this whole choreo perfectly, but him at 3:23 - 3:31 and 4:51 - 4:56 are my favorite parts. That's why Yang Sejong mentioned his beautiful dance line before they won the ""Favorite Male Dance"" award yesterday. He truly is a beautiful dancer, one that everyone recognizes. Also, 3:47, that split. I'll never be over it.",152

After the preformance:
*Ayo* Hit man bang: Who touched the mic while preforming?
BTS: Not me!
Hitman Bang: Probably Namjoon because you brake everything. And Namjoon you are out of the group.
*Next day*
*13 Million people screaming at hitman bang*
*Hitman bang gets fired and Namjoon is back*
