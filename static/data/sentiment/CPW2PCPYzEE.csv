Such a humble response was that. 
If I were that girl. I must have acted differently.

I remember, 
Once I wrote a whole essay and  send long voice clip to one  who told me that he hates  my precious V  
I blocked him and deleted his contact from my phone. But I was so pissed for 2-3 days.. It offended me very badly. 
Even  now I am writing too much..😔

I guess we don't have to do something to shut their mouth. Just let them see our boys achieving great success and prove them all wrong.",26,-0.8311
