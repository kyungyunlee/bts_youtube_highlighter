What do you want to do in the FUTURE with other members?
Tae: I want to see your kids.
ALL flustered. They are thinking NOT what Tae & ARMY are thinking.
Jin: Let me translate. Bla bla bla..

BTS: Phew! That was a close one! We thought Tae wanted to tell ARMY we are all getting married or adopting kids soon!
JK: Gosh hyung i nearly had a heart attack. I am too young to get married oh!
JM: Tae, are you crazy outing all of us like this? Held his hand.
JH: Speechless. Then looks at SG nervously. 
SG: Relaxed babe. Tae doesn't mean that. Chill. Smirked.
NJ: Shocked. Choked on his drink. Speechless. Tae!!! 
JN: Looked at him briefly. Oh dear, he's speechless. He doesn't mean u ok babe? He won't tell tht R&J are our kids. Relax. Look at the cam and quickly saved the others from further embarassment.

Just my IMAGINATION. Don't mind me.

If they had understood Jimin's question: in the FUTURE..

They won't have reacted like that.

Also, if they had understood what Tae meant, 

They won't have reacted like that.

As a conclusion...ARMY, just be cool about it when one day, they decided to inform us about their kids, which they had incredibly protected from 42.9mil ARMY. R E S P E C T. I would just be the first one to CONGRATULATE them for being such great loving protective hubbies and dads! ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡",0,0.9764

To be honest, becoming a fan in 2014, I remember watching you in a music show while waiting for another group (hehehe)
I couldn’t help but compare how hard you worked to that other group and how much you gave your fans
I also saw how rougher around the edges you were, how cheaper (sorrryyy) your clothes looked, how you were unrefined and raw instead of the perfect shiny idols 
But because of this Your sincerity shone through and I remember thinking, “Wow, they work so hard, they want it so bad, I hope they make it”
And you did and I’m so proud of you
Happy Birthday Bangtan!

On a rainy day at BTS practice room.  Jimin and Jungkook were alone practicing. 
But suddenly an unexpected argument arise. Jimin is very upset. 

Jm: Do whatever you want! 

The older between the two shouted. 
Jimin had enough.  And then he walks out to the practice room and leave Jungkook alone. Although its raining hard outside Jimin walks out of the pouring rain deciding to go home. 

After 20 minutes of walking going to their dorm.
Suddenly his phone rings. 
He saw the caller is Jk. He's angry but he still answer it.

""Hyung,  I'm really sorry"" said a crying voice.  

""Yah, don't call me"" Jimin answered back but he's worried.

At that moment Jimin felt pity to the younger boy. And felt conscience. 
'I shoudnt have reacted that way'.  Jimin thought. 

Jm: Yah.  Where are you? I will come and get you. 

Jimin asking worriedly. 

Jk: I don't know hyung. I dont know where I am. 

Jungkook said while still crying. 

Jimin is really worried now cause it still raining hard. 

Jk suggested that he will take the taxi and go home too where Jimin is waiting for him.


As soon as Jungkook arrives.  Jimin runs to him and hug him while crying too. 

Jm: Jungkook-ah.
Jk: I'm sorry hyung.

That day the two boys realize that they can't afford to lose each other.


Many was wondering how Jk and Jm was inseperable.  They are always together but I think this is the proof.

I completely understand why Hobi was unable to explain it, because Tae is just...Tae? He is unapologetically himself and I love him for that.

Hoseok: “Sometimes I wonder,what it was that made ARMY love us.”







Me: Easy:


Personality’s
Laughs
Smiles
Voices
All of their hearts too.
How they saved people from ending their lives
They made people Love Themselves and Speak Themselves.
They changed ARMY’s lives.
They treat ARMY as family.
BTS and ARMY have a strong bond or connection.
They are sincere about every nice,kind,touching and heartwarming thing they say or do.
They are honest.
They worked REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY hard and we appreciate them for that.
ARMY’s are determined to learn korean because of them.
They brightened up ARMY’s Lives.
They made us laugh and smile because of their own laughs and smiles.
True ARMY’s don’t love them mainly because of their appearances,but because of what they do,did,said and say.

We are thankful for the hard work BTS,remember that.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also,since Hoseok asked that question,can I ask a favour to ARMY’s?? Especially the one’s that understand me and are korean:

Can you please translate all this to korean and send it somewhere BTS would see it?? No,not for them to notice me,but for them to see why we love them. But please tell them who made the original comment,I don’t want anyone being selfish saying: “Oh I wrote this.” I don’t feel comfortable with people saying they wrote something they didn’t. It’s lying.

Let’s make them see why we love them ARMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit:
 
30:15 Omg Namjoon you just made me feel better by saying that. I always think: I hear BTS saying “Thank you to our fans who have been there with us since the beginning.” and it makes me feel sad that I haven’t supported them since the beginning.But now I feel better,thank you Namjoon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ARMY tell Namjoon this too;Also mention who told him that.

If you’re wondering why I can’t be able to pass a message to BTS,well,it’s hard to explain. I really can’t.(I have many apps and my device doesn’t take much storage.)

But please let them all know my answer to Hoseok’s question and let Namjoon know that he made many ARMY’s and me feel because of what he said.",0,0.9941

+데뷔 7주년, 너무축하해요😆💜 🎉🎂💐
 벌써 7주년이라니 솔직히 믿기지가 않아요.
더군다나 올해는 여러모로 시간이 빠르게 흘러가고 있는 느낌이라 언제 이렇게 됐나 싶고.
늘 하는 이야기이지만 너무 애썼고 지금까지 달려오느라 고생많았어요:) 앞으로 또 어떤 일들이 생겨날지는 아무도 모르는 일이지만 몸도 마음도 건강히, 오래도록 좋아하는 일 하면서 봤음 좋겠습니다. 응원하고 있어요!💞

코로나 때문에 방탄소년단도, 빅히트도 아미들도 그 외에 정말 많은 분들이 어려워하고 계시잖아요.
ㅜㅜ정말 하루빨리 이 사태가 나아지길 바라면서 우리 모두 마지막까지  거리유지하고, 손씻기,  마스크착용도 꼼꼼하게 해요!😁
모두모두 건강하시고 화이팅!❣️❣️☺️",0,0.2263

its bc BTS taught us how to always be positive, be ourselves and love ourselves. it's okay to be different, being different is not a bad thing, BTS was always there for us and made us feel understood with their music. we have a lot of of reason why we live these 7 boys and we'll always be thankful for u.

7 years with Bangtan Sonyeondan
The years that were lived were years of suffering where you were humiliated and looked down upon by the whole world and also the kpop industry. While all the other fandoms helped Justin b **** r to win on the Billboard, and were busy insulting our fandom (Army), when all the media dropped the name of your BTS to survive until now and make all media now be directed to you, even all the media uses your name solely for fame. Now your names are highly recognized throughout the world. You even joined Unicef ​​to defend the rights of children throughout the world, you care about everything that happens. Error? Obviously you guys often make mistakes .. That's natural, because you're only human. And at the age of 7, we hope you will be better in the future. Of course I will convey this in Weverse in Korean and hope that you (BTS) read it. Thanks for the 7th BTS with Army Forever Together 💜🔰
