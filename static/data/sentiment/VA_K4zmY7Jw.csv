24,"0:24 - 1:07 was V, 1:09 - 1:55 was Jin. 1:57 -  2:19, 3:01 -  3:09 was a bit of piano version of I Need U, 2:33 2:37, 2:46 - 2:57 was more of I Need U, 2:08 Jimin appears, 2:21 - 3:14 was Jimin's dancing. Jimin's dancing was so graceful, fluid, breathtaking, beautiful, amazing, wonderful, great, it was art. 3:16 - 4:06 was Suga & he ended with the thing he does at the end of Fire (Fire, but a different version of it was the song playing). 4:07 - end was J Hope (the music had a couple lines from their song Fake Love). The only members not in this were RM & Jungkook. According to a comment I saw the version BigHit posted before was pre-recorded which is why Jungkook is in that one & he didn't perform live because he couldn't be wet for the next song they were going to perform (Jungkook's solo was him dancing in water to a different version of their song Save Me).",0,0.9716
