330,5:30 is it just me or is the back up dancer pushing jimin's chair late again. like this is the 4th time ive seen in the performance tht the chair was pushed in position after jimin had faked to take a seat. thoughts anyone?,10

How cute he is ,,,",1
330,5:30 Is it normal that Jimin gets his chair a bit later? It was like the MMA performance where everybody had his chair in time excepte Jimin and he then did it without sitting and here it's the same. Of course he is king and can do it without a chair but still it's strange,65
