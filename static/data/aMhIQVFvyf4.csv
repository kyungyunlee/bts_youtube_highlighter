Thank you Yoongi for recognizing Jung Hoseok's power, ability, and charisma. He is exceptional, the world follows Hoseok's rhythm, because when he steps on stage, he stomps and leaves his characteristic mark. A man who turns music into his body, who lives and breathes the music he loves so much. Passion, determination, willpower, perfectionism, and patience: that defines Hoseok.
_Thank you for loving so much the passion that lives in you, Hobito, I love you._",537

I notice that, much like in this case, Namjoon sometimes dances full out or with a pretty high level of energy instead of marking the moves when everyone else does in rehearsals, and the way I see it, it's an attempt to give his best shot at making sure he knows and does the choreo well. So I always appreciate the little effort Namjoon puts in even in more low energy rehearsals, and this is an example of when.",270
