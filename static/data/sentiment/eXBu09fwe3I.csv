I was kind of topper n only ones who cared less about studies n stuff were into K-pop : or that was what my teachers n parents thought.  But I fell in love with their music, concept , ideas n bts was n is my greatest inspiration. But due to that misconception,  I was ridiculed in class.  Like everyone would tease us about it , say cruel things.  I used to think that maybe I wasn't , we weren't that good so people hated what I,we  liked. I didn't want these legends to be hated because of anyone n by anyone cause they helped me accept n love myself so much. So I would try to hide the fact that I was an army.
But I realized that haters gonna hate so we gonna do our thing. I have been stanning bts since not today era n till the end I know I will be a proud army.  Let those haters laugh at us; our stars will shine for eternity. üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú
