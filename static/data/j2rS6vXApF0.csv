30,"0:30 - 1:25 Imma tryna do this for my hiphop performance task in school. Im no dancer, pray for me to not have broken bones 😂 (I’ll be updating this)

Update: It’s so hard but I won’t give up 😭 I super appreciate Jin and Namjoon for being able to keep up with their hard choreo 🤧💜💜 (I think I practiced for a total of 2hrs or more but I only got to cover 0:30 to 0:49)

Update again: It’s just day 2 but my body really hurts so bad. It’s so sore that I can’t even move it. My respect for bts just even got higher. I’ve only covered 0:30 - 1:07 and I’m hoping that I could finish the rest by tomorrow but my body really hurts soo baaddd AND IM HATING HOW THE DANCE LOOKS SO COOL ON BTS BUT I LOOK SO UGLY DOING IT (and I think I practiced for less than an hour because my body really hurts so bad)",31
