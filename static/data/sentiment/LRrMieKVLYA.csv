It's 2020 now, they've come such a long way, yet they are still so humble. Back then, when we as a fandom were not so strong the first person they thanked in their speech was us, ARMY. When they won their first daesang in MAMA, the first person they thanked was ARMY. Even now, in 2020 they are the biggest artists in the world, had 3 daesang all kills, 20 daesang in one year, in every speech, in every action, in every gesture, they have thanked us. They could have easily let the success get to their heads, they didn't let it. Back then, they were only 7 young boys, uncertain of what lay ahead of them, had set out to capture a few hearts with their music. Each time I see them in this video, their immense happiness by just winning a ROTY, I just want to hug them and tell them, that they made it, that all the hardships will pass, that I am so, so proud of them.",1,0.9819
