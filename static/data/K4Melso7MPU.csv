Hurts me to know that Bangtan boys were worried about Jungkook in 2018 Festa and they were worried about Taehyung in 2020 Festa. 😭
Both became more reserved and quiet.

To separate our identities for work and such from ourselves as well.
When we mess up something in life at work, as a friend or whatever.
We shouldn't start to think that we are a failed human being.
We may have done badly at work, but it doesn't mean we are a bad parent/ children.
Everybody has different sides and we are all not perfect.
We have to accept and slowly improve, don't give ourselves overwhelming stress.
Reminder for anyone that spots this comment, you did your best, it's okay, let's do better next time.

I rmb suga said that jungkook's cool for not overthinking things, which implies that he himself thinks too much. Infp more than anyone else wants to be loved for who they are without any conditions or accomplishments. Throughout this hour i noticed that everything suga said tinged with a bit of sadness and negativity. I feel for him. Out of all the members he's probably the one that yearns most for love.",0

I still have a stone in my leg from when I was 6, I was running on a driveway of tiny stones and tripped over my own feet and fell. The stone lodged itself in my knee, the doctor missed it when he took out the other FOUR stones and so it stayed. As I grew it moved up my leg by four inches, and I guess I could have had surgery to take it out when I came of age but I keep it as a trophy to my klutziness 😊.  My boyfriend tells me all the time, ""Honey I love you so much, but you are the most accident-prone person I have ever met!""",1

I stopped keeping track of moments i found funny and i really found it amazing of how far they've come based on what I currently know about them. RM once said that Jimin could be a leader but I didn't really understand why until I finally got to watching this Festa. Jimin really does say alot of wise things, things that I never expected him to say. He's good at empathizing with the other members and doesn't seem to try and hide the expression on his face when another member is sharing a deep thing. He has, what I would call, the ""counsellor face and body language"" cuz he looks at the speaking member's eyes and is able to comfort them with his words even if he isn't in close proximity to them.

I also observe other members the best I can throughout the video while reading the subs, and I gain tremendous amount of appreciation for each and every one of them, even if they haven't spoken as much in this video. 💜💜",4

But I hope and I know they don’t and that is one of the millions of things that I love about BTS. They are themselves and are not afraid to goof around or cry if they want to or need too. And they are so close with fans like i have seen so many celebrities who take their fans for granted and ignore them a lot but BTS have always been so thankful and loving to us and I appreciate that a lot. 💜💜💜💜,0

Seriously though, when Suga talks about not being able to hide themselves on camera, that's exactly the reason why so many people fall in love with BTS. These guys are very unapologetically themselves compared to other kpop groups I've seen, where a lot of them (not all) seem to be maintaining that cookie cutter princely persona that comes off a little stiff and unapproachable. BTS just seems like a bunch of cool dudes I'd like to hang with because of who they are, rather than just the image they're selling. They are welcoming and comforting and sincere with each other and with their fans. :)",1

Well somehow this comment doesn't really relate to the video much but this is my opinion and I just felt like saying this. Thank you guys so much for your music and you really deserve the love and support you have, and of course you deserve more. Keep doing what you do and never give up because we are here for you.
