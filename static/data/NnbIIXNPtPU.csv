140,2:20...Vkook...high five!,2
1,"0:01  Rap Monster (1994) = leader, main rapper, lyricist and composer, fluent in english and especially well known for breaking whatever he touches
0:11  Jungkook (1997) = maknae, main vocalist, lead dancer and rapper (that's why he's called the golden maknae)
0:22  Jimin (1995) = ABS. Just. ABS. Naah jk, he's the main dancer, lead vocalist (his high notes are abdvsjskdllsk!!). Oh and yeah, the man got some abs.
0:50  the one with the blue top is J-Hope (1994) = lead dancer (he's as supple as a noodle!) and rapper, lyricist and composer. Also the most cheerful member.
1:05  the one in the middle is Suga (1993) = lead rapper, lyricist and composer, and epitome of swag and energy. No, the last one is not true.
1:13  red sweater boy is V (1995) or Taehyung (his real name) = an alien, basically. Sub-vocalist and unofficially lead dancer (yeah i include him in the dancers line cause he's really damn good,  i'm a rebel, man watcha gonna do!). He's in his own world and especially famous for his super weird faces and actions. He's EXO's Baekhyun and BAP's Daehyun's son.
1:24  the one in the middle is Jin (1992) = oldest member, sub-vocalist and visual. The typical flower boy and the ""mother"" of the group (loves cooking and the pink color). Also an extremely good dancer as you can see at this moment.

Welcome to the new ARMYs ^^",2
