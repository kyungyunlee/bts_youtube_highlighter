251,"4:11 We really need to understand HOW INTELLIGENT IS JIMIN. Jimin is super intelligent and how he talks and express himself is very mature but still he have his childish self that don't give away his intelligent. We sometimes forget how intelligent he is because he likes to play a lot but Jimin have this kind of thing where he is able to think about his emotions like they are in 3D he sees his emotions from behind like he is not living it but because he is able to do that he can control himself more.Jimin (and others BTS member) is a really role model you can look up on him to feel better, he gives you comfort but still push you to give the best of you like in today's video (2020 class) what he says in his speech was really impressive. Jimin is someone that you want and need as a friend or even someone in your life not just because he is caring and funny but because he is also very Smart and you can go to ask for advice from him, Namjoon even say that he is always asking for advice from Jimin even tho Jimin is Younger than Him and we know how much importance Korean hives to the age. This reminds me at the time where Jackson talk about what is Namjoon for him, he said ""Namjoon is like the end for me, whenever I have a problem I always call him and tell him what is happening to me and Namjoon always hear me until I finish and then told what I should do"" I feel that this that Jackson say about Namjoon is what Namjoon feels about Jimin, Namjoon (and the rest from BTS) have  always tell us since debut they they always come to Jimin whenever they have a problem because Jimin always listen to them and give them advice.",2
