1:29 V's most beautiful, tiny little mole on his nose! Worthy of screen time! Yesss!
1:46 THAT HUG... there are no words!
1:52 Maknae line sitting in the middle while Hyung line surrounds them. Protecting their babies, giving them the sofa... the love.
1:54 These other hugs...
1:56 Everything Suga says, EVERYTHING!
2:12 JHope smiling for us like only he can, spreading sunshine on a very gloomy day!
2:23 I cannot, CANNOT survive V's look... his eyes looking toward the stadium, his heart beating fast as he contemplates the moments with Army... a heaviness in heart but quickly gets taken over by the joy that Army brings him!
2:31 Jin watching over his boys, making sure they fall asleep first. Because a loving and protective big brother secures them first, and then when he's alone and doesn't have to be strong, he releases his pain, lets it out and prays. Only to do it all over again the next day.
2:43 ***THIS TRANSITION IS EVERYTHING!!! The beautiful melody is the echoing sound of love between BTS and Army... crying out because of the distance but knowing nothing can keep them apart!
3:02 Our boys in white surrounded by a sea of white Army lights. White representing the beauty of purity and innocence... a love so real, so true, so everlasting!

Thank you, BTS... for showing us a full day of your life in this crazy 2020. Waking up with Army on your mind, going for a healing drive round town with the boys, playing games in the living room, watching TV, eating pizza, reminiscing, falling asleep and then ending the night dreaming of a date with Army:
BTS on stage, Army surrounding them... We'll be there again, soon!",9

[2027] 

Like an echo in the forest
The day will come back around
As if nothing happened 
Yeah, life goes on

Like an arrow in the blue sky
Another day flying by
On my pillow, on my table
Yeah, life goes on

Like this again

I remember
:I remember the first time I saw you.smiling through the screen of my phone if I see your face or your name 

I remember
:I remember staying up all night watching all your videos. Laughing like there's no problem in this world

I remember
:I remember all the lessons you taught me, the confidence you gave me, the light you gave in the dark, the wings you gave me to fly. yet even had the time to raise my standard so high

I remember
: I remember the first time I actually saw you in real life. It felt like a dream and the last where we all wave our goodbye with tears in our eyes

But what can I say

One day the world stopped
00:22
Without any warning
00:25
Spring didn’t know to wait
00:29
Showed up not even a minute late
00:32
Streets erased of footprints
00:34
I lie here, fallen to the ground
00:38
Time goes by on its own
00:40
Without a single apology
00:44
It looks like rain again today
00:46
I’m soaked to the bone
00:48
Still won’t stop
00:50
Running faster than that cloud of rain
00:52
Thought that’d be enough
00:54
Guess I’m only human after all
00:56
I’m in a world of pain
00:57
This cold the world gave to me
00:59
Prompts me to press the dust-covered rewind
01:02
Dancing off-beat lying on the ground
01:05
Once winter comes, let’s exhale
01:06
A warmer breath
01:09
There’s no end in sight
01:11
Is there a way out?
01:15
My feet refuse to move oh
01:20
Close your eyes for a moment
01:23
Hold my hand
01:26
To that future, let’s run away
01:31
Like an echo in the forest
01:34
The day will come back around
01:37
As if nothing happened
01:40
Yeah life goes on
01:43
Like an arrow in the blue sky
01:46
Another day flying by
01:49
On my pillow, on my table
01:52
Yeah life goes on
01:54
Like this again
01:56
Let me tell you with this song
01:58
People say the world has changed
02:04
But thankfully between you and me
02:05
Nothing’s changed
02:07
With the ""annyeong"" that we start and finish the day
02:10
Let us thread tomorrow with today
02:15
Stopped for now but don’t hide in the shadow
02:17
Once again daylight will glow
02:20
There’s no end in sight
02:23
Is there a way out?
02:26
My feet refuse to move oh
02:31
Close your eyes for a moment
02:34
Hold my hand
