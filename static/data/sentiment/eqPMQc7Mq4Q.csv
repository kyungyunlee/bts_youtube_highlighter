52,"0:52 you can see yoongi turned too big and was covering jimin but moved as he danced to get himself to his right position. when you think about it, alot of details go into performing. not just memorizing the choreo and feeling the song, but being aware of your space while sharing the stage with other people. and being able to adapt when little mistakes like that happen, and looking calm and collected while doing so. yoongi demonstrated that perfectly! overall i hope bts don't overwork themselves and hope they are healthy and happy!",0,0.9862
