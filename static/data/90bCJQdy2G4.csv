First, you got the Maknae line looking SHOOK AF!
Next, you got Suga, who's eyebrows nearly flew off his head with how surprised he was.
Then, you have Rap Mon, who's looking at the other members like, ""Pinch me. Am I dreaming?"".
After that, you got Jhope, who had wide eye's and shouted out ""Really?!"".
Lastly, you got Jin, who looked at Rap Mon with an expression that screams ""Really? We won?!"".
😂😂👏

I am so proud of these precious boys! I hope that Army can help them win another one of these awards. I love them so much and hope that they never stop being their cute, adorable and humble selves.❤❤
