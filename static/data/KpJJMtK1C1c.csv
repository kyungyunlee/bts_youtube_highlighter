338,"5:38 - 5:57 this utterly mesmerising and gorgeous part of the choreo was paid dust by MAMA (well the camerawork was trash in general for the whole performance) and it irks me so much??? Like, they literally zoomed the fuck out and that's how you miss a lot of things in their choreos. It could be the most beautiful choreo but if the camerawork is trash then it diminishes the effect of the whole thing. And it's been happening time and time for bts, it's so annoying. Can they just air bangtantv's recordings of their performances every time instead",0
