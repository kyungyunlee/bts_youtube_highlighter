Or is he just not getting enough rest?
I’m really concerned for some reason
If there IS something wrong then I hope that he gets better
If there ISN’T something wrong then I REALLY hope that he gets more rest if he isn’t
I know he puts a lot of passion in his singing and dancing but he should really get MORE rest if he isn’t getting a lot and he really doesn’t need to work harder than he should because what he’s doing right now is enough to wow us all..

And I really don’t regret stanning BTS because they taught me everything that I should know about how to love myself💜
Thank you BTS for existing because without you I really TRULY wouldn’t have made it this far in life, because before I knew you guys I had really severe depression and I’m thankful that I found you guys during the wings tour because that really DID save me from depression and anxiety like the song was about, so thank you from the bottom of my heart❤️
