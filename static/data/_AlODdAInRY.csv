They form the end of a ferry while Jin comforts Taehyung. Then, the ferry breaks apart and Jimin is standing there. Even at the beginning, it looks like he is reaching for someone he can't reach. When he is with Yoongi, he is always the echo and there seems to be a wall between them. Even at the end, he is reaching for Jin before he comes to hug him as if Jin missed him.",3
