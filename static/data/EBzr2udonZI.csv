8,"0:08 Pose Analysis: Bangtan's thoughts.
Namjoon: Yep these glasses are the bomb- not gonna take them off till I get a new hairstyle but for the moment let me try look cool. Why am I wearing a shirt that says 'RESPECT THE * CKING POSSE? Anyways....

Jungkook: I look so cool right now with my awesome emo hairstyle best concept. Yeah they will finally see me more than just a fetus and Jimin will stop treating me like a toddler... Can't wait to get out of these long socks and into my cool ""ironman ones"".ohhhLook at those muscular arms on Jimin though- focus! focus! ..and dem thighs and the jiboo-FOCUS!! 

Jimin: Is my posture correct.? I bet I look sexy- I hope I do. Too late to worry about that gotta put my jams to work maybe kookie will finally notice me. NOTICE ME SENPAI!!! 

Hoseok: YEAH MANN!! Look at me all crouched down looking like a G. They say I create major heart failures when I dance. Oh shiteu oh shiteu. Not now snakeu. *War flashbacks*  

Jin: I this pose definitely makes me look dope- see what I just did there? Hehuehue. Okay... Hey what is the colour of hamburgers? Burgundy!! Get it?!! Hueueue *insert window wiper sound here*

Taehyung: OMG Joonie hyung looks so cool I can't take my eyes off him...wait aren't we supposed to be making a dance practice video? Oh right... Wow so shiny. Hey I'm in the mirror!! I wonder if this pose will look good? Let me just put my thumb close to my lip like this. AWESOME!! *( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*

Yoongi: Can we start it already I was up all night working and I need to sleep so move along. thank you. And- uh Jimin can you not grab your- yeah it's kinda distracting. Okay focus, summon thine swaeg. 

My thoughts: I'm so freaking proud of my seven sons. Trynna look all super cool for mama. I love you with or without swaeg. Now excuse me while I go and watch all the videos of some really dory talented sexy boys called Bantan Sonyeondan, don't get jealous.
